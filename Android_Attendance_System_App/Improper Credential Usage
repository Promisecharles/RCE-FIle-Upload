# Security Advisory: Improper Credential Usage in Android Application
  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Affected Product:** Android Attendance System App v1.0
**Severity:** High  
**CWE:** CWE-798 - Use of Hard-coded Credentials
**URL**: https://projectworlds.in/android-projects-with-source-code/android-attendance-system-app-source-code/

## Overview
A critical vulnerability has been identified in the Android Attendance System App Android application. The vulnerability is due to **Improper Credential Usage**, which results in the exposure of sensitive SQL queries and user-submitted data in the `adb logcat` logs.

## Description
When a user attempts to insert or submit data within the affected Android application, the SQL query, along with the actual data being submitted, is logged in the `adb logcat` logs. This includes potentially sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, personal details, and other data stored in the application's database. The improper handling of credentials and SQL queries leads to an unintentional exposure of sensitive data, posing a significant security risk.

## Impact
An attacker with access to `adb logcat` logs could exploit this vulnerability to:
- Obtain sensitive information such as user credentials, personal data, and other confidential information.
- Understand the application's database schema, which could be leveraged for further attacks like SQL Injection.
- Compromise user accounts or impersonate legitimate users.

## Affected Versions
- Android Attendance System App version 1.0
- Earlier versions may also be affected.

## Proof of Concept (PoC)
The following steps demonstrate how to exploit this vulnerability using `adb logcat`:

1. **Set Up adb:**
   - Ensure that Android Debug Bridge (adb) is installed on your system and that your Android device is connected via USB with USB debugging enabled.
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. **Launch adb logcat:**
   - Run the following command to start capturing logcat output:
     ```
     adb logcat
     ```

3. **Perform the Vulnerable Action:**
   - Open the [Insert Application Name] on the connected Android device.
   - Navigate to the section where the vulnerable data submission occurs (e.g., a login or registration form).
   - Input some test data into the form fields and submit the data.

4. **Monitor logcat Output:**
   - Observe the `adb logcat` output in the terminal.
   - You should see the SQL query along with the data you submitted in plain text. The log output might look something like this:
     ```
     INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES ('testuser', 'testpassword');
     ```
   - This indicates that both the SQL query and sensitive data are being logged.

5. **Analyze the Logs:**
   - Confirm that the SQL query and sensitive data are exposed. This could include user credentials, personal information, or other sensitive data.

## Mitigation
Immediate action is recommended to mitigate this vulnerability:
1. **Avoid Logging Sensitive Information:** Ensure that SQL queries and user-submitted data are not logged in `adb logcat`. Review all logging practices within the application to prevent sensitive data exposure.
2. **Sanitize Log Output:** If logging is necessary, sanitize any output to exclude sensitive information, or use logging levels that exclude verbose information in production builds.
3. **Encrypt Sensitive Data:** Implement encryption for sensitive data both at rest and in transit to add an extra layer of security.
4. **Update the Application:** Users are advised to update to the latest version of the application once a patch is released.

## Recommendations
- **For Developers:** Audit the application's logging mechanism and ensure that no sensitive data is exposed through logs. Consider implementing logging best practices, such as using secured logging frameworks and reducing log verbosity in production environments.
- **For Users:** Until an update is available, avoid submitting sensitive data through the application if possible. Be cautious of the environments where the application is used, particularly where `adb logcat` access is available.
